      <p>
        Roll game is a 2 player game, playing in rounds, In each turn, a player
        rolls 2 dice as many times as he wishes. Each result will get added to
        his round’s score. But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s
        score gets lost. After that, it's the next player’s turn. A player can
        choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his round’s score gets added to his
        global score. After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player
        to pass predefined score points loose. The first player to reach
        predefined score exactly wins.
